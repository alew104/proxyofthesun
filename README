This program serves to act as a HTTP proxy that will take in HTTP 1.0 get requests and
parses the requests to send to a remote server wherefter the proxy will redirect 
output from the remote server back to our client. This program acts as a full blown proxy now and takes in the url submitted to submit to our proxy and we open a thread to send to the remote and another thread to send back to client. 

Some strengths is that as long as user inputs valid uri requests, program should work as intended.
It is also not too fault tolerant. There is also a while loop for our receiving requests from the client.
Some heavy elements such as big image files take a long time to load.
Also if we encounter timeouts from remote servers our proxy cannot handle that properly. 


Sunny did some string parsing, validation, readme, general testing and debugging.
Alex started the multithreading and did the socket programming.
Daniel did port number parsing, header and buffer work.
